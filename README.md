👋🏽 Hi world! I'm Rhett, and I'm passionate about tackling complex challenges through creative problem-solving, analytical thinking, and teamwork. My diverse background includes experience in management consulting, strategy and operations, supply chain, and serving as an Air Force officer. Throughout my 14+ year career, I've demonstrated a commitment to growth through comfort with ambiguity, persistence, adaptability, curiosity, and openness. I have honed my skills in bridging the "what" with the "how" to achieve strategic objectives. My leadership philosophy is to lead by example.
